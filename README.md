# Covid-19-Dashboard
* This is a Dataset from kaggle that contains **Covid-19** data which includes number of Active cases, Confirmed cases, Recovered and Deaths by Country and WHO Region for Year 2020.
* I created a Dashboard to show the Total number of Recovered, Active and Confirmed Cases.
* I showed the Total Confirmed, Recoverd and Active cases by WHO Region and Quarter of the Year.
* I also showed the Ratio of Death and Active cases.
