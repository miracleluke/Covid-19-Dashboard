# Covid-19-Dashboard
* This is a Dataset from kaggle that contains **Covid-19** data which includes number of Active cases, Confirmed cases, Recovered and Deaths by Country and WHO Region for Year 2020.
* I created a Dashboard to show the total number of Deaths, Recovered, Active and Confirmed cases by Country.
* I showed the Average number of Deaths, Confirmed and Active cases by WHO Region and Quarter of the Year.
* I also showed the Ratio of Death and Active cases.
